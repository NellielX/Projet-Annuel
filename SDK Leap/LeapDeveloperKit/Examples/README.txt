Leap SDK Examples Folder
================================================================================

The Leap Example folder contains example code and demonstration applications
for the Leap API. The example applications contain source code, project files,
and pre-built executables (where possible). The demo programs are provided to
illustrate some of the creative possibilities of the Leap.

Folder contents:

    Technology demo:
        FlockingDemo (Windows and Mac only)
    
    Example programs with source code:
        FingerVisualizer
        GesturesDemo (Windows and Mac only)
        MotionVisualizer
        UnitySandbox

To compile the example programs, the LeapSDK folder must be in the same
directory as the main Examples folder. The example projects are set up to
look for the header files and libraries in this location. If you move an
example project or the SDK relative to each other, you must update the include
file and header references also.
 
Before running an example or demo program, make sure you are running a version
of the Leap application compatible with this version of the SDK. You can check
the version number of the Leap application by opening the About window.
