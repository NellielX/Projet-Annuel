Leap SDK Examples -- Motion Visualizer
================================================================================

MotionVisualizer illustrates how to use the motion factors available from Hand
and Frame objects in the Leap Motion API.

The MotionVisualizer displays an infinite 3D grid that you can rotate, scale and 
translate by moving your hands and fingers around in the Leap field of view.

Key Leap source files:

* Main.cpp                        -- The main application source file.
* LeapUtilGL.h and LeapUtilGL.cpp -- OpenGL utilities.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Usage:

Perform translation, rotation, and scale motions by moving one or both hands 
within the Leap field of view. 

One-handed motions (using Hand object motion factors):
* Translation -- Move your hand up, down, right, left, forward, and backward.
* Rotation    -- Turn or twist your hand.
* Scale       -- Pinch or extend your fingers.

Two-handed motions (using Frame object motion factors):
* Translation -- Move both hands in the same direction.
* Rotation    -- Move your hands as if around a circle.
* Scale       -- Move your hands toward or away from each other.


Other controls:

Left/Right/Up/Down arrow keys rotate the scene.
Dragging the mouse rotates the scene.
Rolling the mouse wheel changes camera distance.

H -- toggle the help overlay
R -- toggle rotation
S -- toggle scaling
T -- toggle translation

Space -- reset the camera and scene

3 -- toggle red/blue sterio-3D drawing mode
Page Up -- increase left/right eye offset for red/blue 3D mode
Page Down -- decrease left/right eye offset for red/blue 3D mode

Esc -- quit the program

Compiling the source code:

We created this example using the *Juce* cross-platform C++ class library. 
The Juce modules provide easy to use APIs for window, graphics, and sound among
other things. Juce also provides the IntroJucer project utility provides project 
files for Microsoft Visual Studio and Apple Xcode. We have already created 
project files for the example projects, but feel free to adjust the IntroJucer 
settings and regenerate your own project files.

You can learn more about Juce at: http://rawmaterialsoftware.com/juce.php


To open the example in Visual Studio or Xcode:

1. Navigate to the project's Builds folder.
2. Find the project file for your IDE:
   On Mac, we provide Xcode project files.
   On Windows, we provide Visual Studio 2008 and Visual Studio 2010 project files.
 
To compile the example programs, the LeapSDK folder must be in the same 
directory as the main Examples folder. The project is set up to
look for the header files and libraries in this location. If you move the 
project or the SDK, you must update the include file and header references also.
     

To run the pre-built executable:

1. Launch the Leap application.
2. Launch the MotionVisualizer program found in the example folder. 


To generate a project file with IntroJucer:

1. Run IntroJucer.
   You can use the IntroJucer binary included in this package at:
   ThirdParty/JUCE/bin or get a copy from: 
   http://sourceforge.net/projects/juce/files/juce/
2. Open the ProjectName.jucer file found inside the example project folder.
3. Select a project file type on the IntroJucer window.
4. Make your changes. You can change settings for the project as a whole as well 
   as settings specifically for debug and release configurations.
5. Save the project file changes.

Graphics cards:

The Leap Motion C++ sample code make use of the JUCE cross-platform
application framework.  The 3D drawing is done using OpenGL in conjunction with
JUCE support for OpenGL drawing.

Integrated graphics card OpenGL drivers have been known to perform slowly or
improperly.

If you are building or running on a laptop with integrated graphics as well
as a discrete graphics card you may wish to change your graphics settings to
always use the discrete graphics card.
