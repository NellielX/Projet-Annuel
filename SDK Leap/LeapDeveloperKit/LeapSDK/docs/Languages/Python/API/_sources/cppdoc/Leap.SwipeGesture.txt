Leap.SwipeGesture
=================

.. currentmodule:: Leap

.. class:: SwipeGesture

  Extends :class:`Leap.Gesture`.

  The SwipeGesture class represents a swiping motion of a finger or tool.

  Important: To use swipe gestures in your application, you must enable
  recognition of the swipe gesture. You can enable recognition with:
 
  .. literalinclude:: ../../../codeexamples/includes/python/Gesture_Swipe_Enable.txt
 
  Swipe gestures are continuous.
 
  You can set the minimum length and velocity required for a movement
  to be recognized as a swipe using the config attribute of a connected
  Controller object. Use the following keys to configure swipe recognition:
 
  ====================================  ========== ============= =======
  Key string                            Value type Default value Units
  ====================================  ========== ============= =======
  Gesture.Swipe.MinLength               float      150           mm
  Gesture.Swipe.MinVelocity             float      1000          mm/s
  ====================================  ========== ============= =======
 
  The following example demonstrates how to set the swipe configuration
  parameters:

  .. container:: constructors
  
    .. classmethod:: SwipeGesture([gesture])

      Constructs a SwipeGesture object from an instance of the Gesture class.
 
      **Arguments**
    
      ``gesture`` (:class:`Leap.Gesture`) -- The Gesture instance to specialize. This Gesture instance must
      be a SwipeGesture object. If no argument is supplied, an invalid SwipeGesture object is created.

  .. container:: attributes
  
    .. attribute:: startPosition -> Leap.Vector
  
      The position where the swipe began.
   
      .. versionadded:: 1.0
   

    .. attribute:: position -> Leap.Vector
  
      The current position of the swipe.
   
      .. versionadded:: 1.0
   

    .. attribute:: direction -> Leap.Vector
  
      The unit direction vector parallel to the swipe motion.
   
      You can compare the components of the vector to classify the swipe as
      appropriate for your application. For example, if you are using swipes
      for two dimensional scrolling, you can compare the x and y values to
      determine if the swipe is primarily horizontal or vertical.
   
      .. versionadded:: 1.0
   

    .. attribute:: speed -> float
  
      The swipe speed in mm/second.
   
      .. versionadded:: 1.0
   

    .. attribute:: pointable -> Leap.Pointable
  
      The finger performing the swipe gesture.
   
      .. versionadded:: 1.0

 
  .. container:: data
  
    .. classmethod:: class_type -> int

      The swipe gesture type designator: :data:`Gesture.TYPE_SWIPE`
