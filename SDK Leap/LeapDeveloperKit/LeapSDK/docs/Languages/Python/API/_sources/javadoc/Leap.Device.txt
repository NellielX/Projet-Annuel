Leap.Device
===========

.. currentmodule:: Leap

.. class:: Leap.Device

  The Device class represents a physically connected device.

  The Device class contains information related to a particular connected
  device such as field of view, device id, and calibrated positions.

  Note that Device objects can be invalid, which means that they do not contain
  valid device information and do not correspond to a physical device.
  Test for validity with the :attr:`Device.is_valid` property.

  .. container:: constructors
  
    .. classmethod:: Device()

      Constructs a Device object.

      An uninitialized device is considered invalid.
      Get valid Device objects from a DeviceList object obtained using the
      :class:`Leap.Controller.devices()` method.

  .. container:: attributes
  
    .. attribute:: horizontal_view_angle

      The angle of view along the x axis of this device.

      .. image:: ../../../images/Leap_horizontalViewAngle.png

      The Leap Motion controller scans a region in the shape of an inverted pyramid
      centered at the device's center and extending upwards. The ``horizontal_view_angle``
      reports the view angle along the long dimension of the device.

      .. versionadded:: 1.0


    .. attribute:: vertical_view_angle

      The angle of view along the z axis of this device.

      .. image:: ../../../images/Leap_verticalViewAngle.png

      The Leap Motion controller scans a region in the shape of an inverted pyramid
      centered at the device's center and extending upwards. The ``vertical_view_angle``
      reports the view angle along the short dimension of the device.

      .. versionadded:: 1.0


    .. attribute:: range

      The maximum reliable tracking range.

      The range reports the maximum recommended distance from the device center
      for which tracking is expected to be reliable. This distance is not a hard limit.
      Tracking may be still be functional above this distance or begin to degrade slightly
      before this distance depending on calibration and extreme environmental conditions.

      .. versionadded:: 1.0


    .. attribute:: is_valid

      Reports whether this is a valid Device object.

      .. versionadded:: 1.0



  .. container:: methods

    .. method:: distance_to_boundary(position)

      The distance to the nearest edge of the Leap Motion controller's view volume.

      The view volume is an axis-aligned, inverted pyramid centered on the device origin
      and extending upward to the range limit. The walls of the pyramid are described
      by the ``horizontal_view_angle`` and ``vertical_view_angle`` and the roof by the ``range``.
      This function estimates the distance between the specified input position and the
      nearest wall or roof of the view volume.

      **Arguments**

      position (:class:`Leap.Vector`) -- The point to use for the distance calculation.

      **Returns** 

      float -- The distance in millimeters from the input position to the nearest boundary.

  .. container:: operators

    .. method:: eq(a, b)

      Compare Device object equality.

      Two Device objects are equal if and only if both Device objects represent the
      exact same Device and both Devices are valid.

      .. versionadded:: 1.0


    .. method:: ne(a, b)

      Compare Device object inequality.

      Two Device objects are equal if and only if both Device objects represent the
      exact same Device and both Devices are valid.

      .. versionadded:: 1.0


.. container:: data

  .. data:: Leap.Device.invalid

    An invalid Device object.

    You can use the instance returned by this function in comparisons testing
    whether a given Device instance is valid or invalid. (You can also use the
    :func:`is_valid()` function.)

    .. versionadded:: 1.0
