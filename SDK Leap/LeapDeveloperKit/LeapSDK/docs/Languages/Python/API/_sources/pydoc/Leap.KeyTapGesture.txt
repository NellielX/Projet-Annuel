Leap.KeyTapGesture
==================

.. currentmodule:: Leap

.. class:: KeyTapGesture

  Extends :class:`Leap.Gesture`.

  The KeyTapGesture class represents a tapping gesture by a finger or tool.
 
  A key tap gesture is recognized when the tip of a finger rotates down toward the
  palm and then springs back to approximately the original postion, as if
  tapping. The tapping finger must pause briefly before beginning the tap.

  Important: To use key tap gestures in your application, you must enable
  recognition of the key tap gesture. You can enable recognition with:
 
  .. literalinclude:: ../../../codeexamples/includes/python/Gesture_KeyTap_Enable.txt
 
  Key tap gestures are discrete. The KeyTapGesture object representing a tap always
  has the state, STATE_STOP. Only one KeyTapGesture object is created for each
  key tap gesture recognized.
 
  You can set the minimum finger movement and velocity required for a movement
  to be recognized as a key tap as well as adjust the detection window for
  evaluating the movement using the config attribute of a connected
  Controller object. Use the following configuration keys to configure key tap
  recognition:
 
  ====================================  ========== ============= =======
  Key string                            Value type Default value Units
  ====================================  ========== ============= =======
  Gesture.KeyTap.MinDownVelocity        float      50            mm/s
  Gesture.KeyTap.HistorySeconds         float      0.1           s
  Gesture.KeyTap.MinDistance            float      3.0           mm

  The following example demonstrates how to set the key tap configuration

  .. versionadded:: 1.0


  .. container:: constructors
  
    .. classmethod:: KeyTapGesture([gesture])

      Constructs a KeyTapGesture object from an instance of the Gesture class.
 
      **Arguments**
    
      ``gesture`` (:class:`Leap.Gesture`) -- The Gesture instance to specialize. This Gesture instance must
       be a KeyTapGesture object. If no argument is supplied, an invalid KeyTapGesture object is created.
    
      .. versionadded::  1.0


  .. container:: attributes
  
    .. attribute:: position -> Leap.Vector
  
      The position where the key tap is registered.
   
      .. versionadded:: 1.0
   

    .. attribute:: direction -> Leap.Vector
  
      The direction of finger tip motion. If the finger is stationary, at the time
      this gesture object is recorded, then the direction will be a zero vector.
   
      .. versionadded:: 1.0
   

    .. attribute:: progress -> float
  
      The progess value is always 1.0 for a key tap gesture.

      .. versionadded:: 1.0
   

    .. attribute:: pointable -> Leap.Pointable
  
      The finger performing the key tap gesture.
   
      .. versionadded:: 1.0
   
   
   .. container:: data
   
     .. data:: class_type -> int

       The key tap gesture type designator: :data:`Gesture.TYPE_KEY_TAP`
