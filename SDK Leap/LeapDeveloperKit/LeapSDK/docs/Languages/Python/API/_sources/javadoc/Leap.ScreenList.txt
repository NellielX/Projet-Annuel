Leap.ScreenList
===============

.. currentmodule:: Leap

.. class:: ScreenList

  The ScreenList class represents a list of Screen objects.

  The list always contains at least one entry representing the default
  screen. If the user has not registered the location of this default
  screen, then the coordinates, directions, and other values reported by
  the functions in its Screen object will not be accurate. Other monitor
  screens only appear in the list if their positions have been registered
  using the Leap Motion Screen Locator.
 
  Get a ScreenList object from :attr:`Controller.located_screens`.
