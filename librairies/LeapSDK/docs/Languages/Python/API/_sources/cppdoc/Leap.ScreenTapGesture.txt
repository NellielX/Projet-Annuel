Leap.ScreenTapGesture
=====================

.. currentmodule:: Leap

.. class:: ScreenTapGesture

  Extends :class:`Leap.Gesture`.

  A screen tap gesture is recognized when the tip of a finger pokes forward
  and then springs back to approximately the original postion, as if
  tapping a vertical screen. The tapping finger must pause briefly before beginning the tap.

  **Important:** To use screen tap gestures in your application, you must enable
  recognition of the screen tap gesture. You can enable recognition with:
  
  .. literalinclude:: ../../../codeexamples/includes/python/Gesture_ScreenTap_Enable.txt
  
  ScreenTap gestures are discrete. The ScreenTapGesture object representing a tap always
  has the state, STATE_STOP. Only one ScreenTapGesture object is created for each
  screen tap gesture recognized.
  
  You can set the minimum finger movement and velocity required for a movement
  to be recognized as a screen tap as well as adjust the detection window for
  evaluating the movement using the config attribute of a connected
  Controller object. Use the following keys to configure screen tap recognition:
 
  ====================================  ========== ============= =======
  Key string                            Value type Default value Units
  ====================================  ========== ============= =======
  Gesture.ScreenTap.MinForwardVelocity  float      50            mm/s
  Gesture.ScreenTap.HistorySeconds      float      0.1           s
  Gesture.ScreenTap.MinDistance         float      5.0           mm

  The following example demonstrates how to set the key tap configuration
  parameters:

  .. versionadded:: 1.0

  .. container:: constructors
  
    .. classmethod:: ScreenTapGesture([gesture])

      Constructs a ScreenTapGesture object from an instance of the Gesture class.
 
      **Arguments**
    
      ``gesture`` (:class:`Leap.Gesture`) -- The Gesture instance to specialize. This Gesture instance must
      be a ScreenTapGesture object. If no argument is supplied, an invalid ScreenTapGesture object is created.
    
      .. versionadded::  1.0


  .. container:: attributes
  
    .. attribute:: position -> Leap.Vector
  
      The position where the screen tap is registered.
   
      .. versionadded:: 1.0
   

    .. attribute:: direction -> Leap.Vector
  
      The direction of finger tip motion. If the finger is stationary, at the time
      this gesture object is recorded, then the direction will be a zero vector.
   
      .. versionadded:: 1.0
   

    .. attribute:: progress -> float
  
      The progess value is always 1.0 for a screen tap gesture.

      .. versionadded:: 1.0
   

    .. attribute:: pointable -> Leap.Pointable
  
      The finger performing the screen tap gesture.
   
      .. versionadded:: 1.0
   
   
   .. container:: data
   
     .. classmethod:: class_type -> int

       The screen tap gesture type designator: :data:`Gesture.TYPE_SCREEN_TAP`
 
       .. versionadded::  1.0
