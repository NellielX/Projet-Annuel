Leap.Tool
=========

.. currentmodule:: Leap

.. class:: Tool

  Extends :class:`Leap.Pointable`.
  
  The Tool class represents a tracked tool.
  
  Tools are Pointable objects that the Leap Motion software has classified as a tool.
  Tools are longer, thinner, and straighter than a typical finger.
  Get valid Tool objects from a Frame or a Hand object.
  
  Tools may reference a hand, but unlike fingers they are not permanently associated.
  Instead, a tool can be transferred between hands while keeping the same ID.

  Note that Tool objects can be invalid, which means that they do not contain
  valid tracking data and do not correspond to a physical tool. Invalid Tool
  objects can be the result of asking for a Tool object using an ID from an
  earlier frame when no Tool objects with that ID exist in the current frame.
  A Tool object created from the Tool constructor is also invalid.
  Test for validity with the :attr:`Tool.is_valid` property.

    .. classmethod:: Tool([tool]);

      Constructs a Tool object.
   
      Get valid Tool and Pointable objects from a Frame or a Hand object.
    
      **Arguments**
    
      ``tool`` (:class:`Leap.Pointable`) -- an object representing a tool. 
      If no tool parameter is supplied, or the object does not represent a tool,
      an ``invalid`` Tool object is returned.

  .. container:: data
  
    .. data:: Tool.invalid -> Leap.Tool
  
      An invalid Tool object.
   
      You can use this invalid object in comparisons testing
      whether a given Tool instance is valid or invalid. (You can also use the
      :attr:`Pointable.is_valid` attribute.)
